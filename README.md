### First things first...

1. If you haven't installed docker on your system, please do so!
2. If you haven't installed node on your system, please do so as well.
3. Clone the master branch to your machine.
4. To clear things up with docker-compose do the following things:
 `docker-compose down`

### For starting the app

1. Go inside the wordSentenceMatcher folder
2. Run
